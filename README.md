<h2 align= "center">Mathysic Guide</h2>
<p> Hi! You are currently in the mathysic repository. First, what is this mathysic? Mathysic is an application that allows you to make many physics and mathematics transaction. Math + Physic = Mathysic ,here is that's as simple as :) You can use Mathysic app in two ways right now:</p> 
<b> --> As a Terminal app.</b> <br>
<b> --> And as a Discord bot.</b> <br> <br> 
Let's first see how the terminal application can be used. <br>

<h2> Mathysic Terminal App Usage </h2>
<p> All you have to do to use the Terminal app, find <b>'Matsycich-Terminal-App'</b> file in the Mathysic repository. If you want, you can download and run this file or directly copy the codes from the file and run in a Python interpreter. In addition, because this project is an open source project, you can review the codes of the project as you wish. Now when we run the code, we will show to you what you can do on the terminal screen. </p>
------------------------------------<br>
Welcome to Mathysic !<br>

'0' is for Exit <br>

'1' is for Calculator <br>

'2' is for Physics <br>

'3' is for Mathematics <br> <br>


<strong> Enter your choice: </strong> <br>
------------------------------------ <br>
A field similar to that will come to your screen. Here you can turn off the application in the terminal by typing <b>'0'</b>. <br><br>

By typing <b>'1'</b>, you can reach the calculator.<br><br>

You can reach various operations in the Physics section by typing <b>'2'</b>. <br><br>

And finally, you can reach the transactions in the math department by typing <b>'3'</b>.<br> <br>


Based on the number value you enter, many new choice will come to the terminal screen. But don't worry, to understand these options and to use is quite easy. <br><br>
<b> Note:</b> The terminal application can work on all operating systems installed Python. 

<h2> Mathysic Discord Bot Usage </h2>
As in the terminal application, this bot is an open-source bot. You can easily add this bot to your Discord server. A link to add the bot:<br>


Now let's learn the necessary commands to use the bot.<br><br>
<b> Note:</b> We use the 'm/' before the commands. Because we need to specify that this is  a mathysic's command.
